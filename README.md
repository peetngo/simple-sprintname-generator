Simple Sprint Name Generator

I built this super simple app that will give you a list of words with 
constraints that you set to it. For example, if you are in E Sprint in 
your agile workflow and you need a name that starts with an "E", choose
"E" from the drop down and add a word's meaning that you want the "E"
word to be similar to. It will then give you a list of those words. I
built this due to the fact that I am terrible at coming up with names
and at my previous experience, I had to come up with a name for a sprint. 
Although this is a super simple app, I decided to use Vue.js and Buefy for
the front end and using axios to make the call to the API. Overall,
this was a great learning experience.
